1. Review the transition between the second and third paragraphs. The last sentence of the second paragraph, "Protoframe specifically addresses this deficit...", directly introduces the solution before the third paragraph formally proposes it. Consider integrating this idea more smoothly into the opening of the third paragraph or making the end of the second paragraph focus solely on the gap, allowing the third paragraph to introduce the solution afresh.

2. In the third paragraph, ensure the benefits and promises are explicitly tied to why these mechanisms are novel or superior, rather than just stating what they do. While well-described, slightly strengthen the "promise" aspect, e.g., how these mechanisms promise to transform workflows.

3. In the fourth paragraph, while discussing the "novelty" of juxtaposed sequential images, briefly and concisely compare it to the underlying technical complexity of generating continuous video motion versus generating static images. This will further emphasize the technical challenge overcome.

4. For the "version control across fidelity" mechanism in the fourth paragraph, expand slightly on how it leverages "efficient storage and intelligent differential updates." A very brief, high-level technical hint (e.g., "by storing only deltas between fidelity levels" if applicable) would strengthen the technical novelty without adding excessive detail.

5. In the experiments paragraph (P6), instead of merely stating "Our findings confirmed this" and "which our user studies supported," use stronger, more specific verbs. For example, "Our findings demonstrated this reduction" or "User studies validated this claim." This provides a more assertive stance on the results.

6. In the experiments paragraph (P6), when describing the comparison to existing systems, briefly mention how the metrics collected (e.g., "time to first viable prototype," "number of iterations") directly quantify the "better than relevant systems" aspect beyond just "substantial improvements." For instance, "These metrics quantified the inefficiency of existing TTV workflows..."

7. Ensure consistent use of "protoframe" (lowercase or capitalized) throughout the document. Currently, it's mostly capitalized when referring to the product name or the core concept, but sometimes lowercase when referring to an individual instance. Clarify for consistency.

8. Scan the entire document for any remaining instances of passive voice, especially those that can be easily converted to active voice to adhere more strictly to "The Elements of Style." (e.g., "resources are selectively utilized" -> "the system selectively utilizes resources"). The paper is already very strong in this regard, but a final check is always good.

1. Conduct experiments and report findings in the past tense. Your "Experiments" section describes experiments in the future tense ("we plan to conduct," "will involve," "we will measure"). For a research paper, you must conduct these experiments and present your findings with concrete data and analysis. If this paper is a proposal for future work, clarify its scope in the introduction. Otherwise, complete the experiments and update this section to reflect actual, completed work, reporting everything in the past tense.

2. Refine the fourth contribution bullet point. The final bullet point in your contributions section ("This paper demonstrates how these technical innovations collectively reduce video conceptualization...") describes the impact or benefit of your other contributions rather than a distinct new knowledge contribution itself. Rephrase it to explicitly state a technical contribution or integrate this statement into your introduction or conclusion if it serves as a summary of the paper's overall value. All bulleted contributions should represent distinct pieces of new knowledge.

3. Actively rephrase passive voice constructions for clarity and conciseness. Review your entire paper, particularly paragraphs 2 and 4, and convert passive voice to active voice wherever possible. For instance, instead of "there is no effective solution that marries..." consider "No effective solution marries..." or instead of "it is a specialized system engineered to manage..." consider "This specialized system engineers the management of..." This will make your prose more direct and impactful.

4. Prepare your final paper in LaTeX format. This feedback is in plain text, but remember to format your final research paper submission strictly according to scientific standards, including the use of LaTeX as specified.

Here is your actionable to-do list for revising your research paper draft:

1. Revise First Paragraph Opening: Change the very first sentence to remove "While" and begin with a direct, universally agreed-upon statement. For example, start with a declaration about the importance or current state of Text-to-Video generation, then immediately introduce the core problem of computational intensity and its impact on creative workflows.

2. Strengthen Literature Review in Second Paragraph: Expand on the "existing TTV systems" and "related generative AI tools" mentioned. Identify 1-2 specific and prominent examples (e.g., particular diffusion models or well-known TTV research efforts) and briefly explain why these existing solutions do not adequately address the rapid prototyping and iterative design gap. This will make your research gap more concrete and grounded in existing work.

3. Reformat and Refine Contributions Section:
 Convert the final paragraph into a bulleted list to clearly delineate your contributions, as required by the heuristics.
 For each bullet point, explicitly state "We contribute..." or "This paper contributes..."
 Ensure each contribution is a distinct piece of new knowledge or a novel technical innovation* (e.g., the abstraction, the specialized version control, the rendering mechanism). Avoid simply restating the benefits or promises. For example, "making AI video generation more accessible" is a benefit, not a core scientific contribution for this section. Focus on the underlying technical advancements.

4. Reduce Passive Voice: Carefully review the entire paper, especially the "Implementation" section (paragraph 5). Rephrase sentences that use passive voice into active voice. For instance, instead of "A custom database schema efficiently stores...", write "Our custom database schema efficiently stores..." or "We employ a custom database schema that efficiently stores...".

5. Specify Experimental Baselines: In the "Experiments" section (paragraph 6), clarify what "existing Text-to-Video (TTV) workflows" refers to when describing your control group comparison. Are you comparing against specific commercial tools, academic prototypes, or a generalized conceptual baseline? Providing this context will strengthen your experimental design description.

6. Eliminate Redundancy: Read through the entire paper to identify and remove any repetitive statements or ideas. Pay close attention to descriptions of Protoframe's mechanisms and benefits, ensuring they are presented clearly and concisely in each relevant section without unnecessary reiteration, particularly between paragraphs 3, 4, and 7.

7. Review Overall Flow and Sentence Openings: While you've addressed the specific "While" issue, do a general sweep of the paper to ensure smooth transitions between sentences and paragraphs. Look for any other weak or less formal sentence beginnings that could be strengthened for a more impactful scientific presentation.
