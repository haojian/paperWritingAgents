[establishes a foundational premise/general truth]. [elaborates on the importance and specific ways researchers use prior work]. [introduces a specific method of engaging with prior work]. [explains the dual benefits of reading papers, highlighting the role of related work sections and inline citations]. [further explains the benefits and outcomes of using inline citations for literature review]. [summarizes and emphasizes the importance of inline citations]. [provides empirical evidence and common terminology for the use of inline citations]. [provides specific quantitative evidence of the importance of inline citations for paper discovery]. [introduces a problem or challenge related to the use of inline citations, despite their utility]. [explains the nature of the challenge identified in the previous sentence]. [highlights a specific context where the problem is exacerbated]. [provides a concrete example to illustrate the problem of relevance and prioritization]. [transitions to existing solutions or related work, setting the stage for discussing their limitations]. [provides a specific category of existing research systems and their approach]. [continuation of the previous sentence, part of an enumeration]. [provides citations for the examples of standalone paper discovery tools]. [presents another category of existing research systems and their functionalities related to citation analysis]. [continuation of the previous sentence, part of an enumeration].

[explains the importance and necessity of addressing the identified research gap]. [states the main objective or purpose of the current paper]. [introduces the foundational insight for the proposed solution, derived from user research]. [provides an illustrative example to clarify the 'cited by multiple papers' concept and its relevance]. [explains why the identified need (tracking multi-cited papers) is difficult with current tools, further highlighting the problem]. [identifies another specific limitation of current reading tools regarding citation tracking]. [explains a further difficulty, even if a user *does* recognize a citation, due to lack of context]. [continuation of the previous sentence, part of an enumeration]. [provides examples of missing context and explains the consequence]. [summarizes the impact of the identified problems on users, reinforcing the need for the proposed solution]. [introduces the overarching solution/approach of the paper].

[provides information about the design process and validation of CiteSee]. [explains a key design challenge and how it was tackled, highlighting the nuanced aspects of the solution]. [introduces the list of contributions of the paper]. [states the first contribution: the developed tool]. [distinguishes CiteSee's contribution from prior work, emphasizing its novelty and specific focus]. [states the second contribution: the underlying mechanisms for augmentation and personalized context]. [states the third contribution: the results of a controlled lab study]. [states the fourth contribution: the results and insights from a field deployment study]
