    Machine learning has revolutionized healthcare in recent years. 
    However, current methods still face significant challenges in clinical decision-making.
    Existing approaches often lack interpretability, which is crucial for medical applications.
    For example, deep learning models are frequently criticized as "black boxes" that fail to provide explanations for their predictions.
    This limitation becomes critical when medical professionals need to understand why a particular diagnosis or treatment recommendation was made.
    Therefore, there is an urgent need for interpretable machine learning methods in healthcare.
    In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines the accuracy of deep learning with the interpretability of traditional rule-based systems.
