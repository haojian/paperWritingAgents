======== Writing Heuristics ======== 
1. The writings should be ground in new knowledge contributions. Avoid redundancy. Don't repeat. It's for scientific research. No bullshit. So avoid sales pitch without concrete evidence. 
2. Follow the styles in book "The Elements of Style". For example, avoid passive tense as much as possible. 
3. Have the contributions in the bullet points.  Also state explicitly, we contributes blabla.
4. Write the system design in the present tense, but write all the experiments in the past tense.
